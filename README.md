# Springboot-JPA-BackEnd
A simple ERP Web back end

I use Thymeleaf template engine to build up front end as simply as possible due to prevent to leak business information.

Data Base is Mysql 8.0 and all table information please look over the package of pojo

All the API information on the http://localhost:8080/swagger.

This is  demo of ERP project only.
